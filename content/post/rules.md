To conduct the tournament in a professional manner, we will implement most of the FIBA 3X3 rules.
<!--more-->

**Match Duration** : 8 + 8 minutes (+2 mins OT) Running Clock. The game clock shall only be stopped during free throws.  
**Match Format** &nbsp; :   3v3  
**Timeouts** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : 2 Timeouts of 30 seconds/half \
A timeout may only be requested by the team players (Playing/Bench) when the ball is dead or in control of the team making the request.  

The **initial** possession of the ball will be decided by a toss, and would switch in the next half.  

**Clearance**  
Following each successful field goal of the last free throw (except those followed by ball posession):
1. A player from the non-scoring team shall resume the game by dribbling or passing the ball from inside the court directly underneath the basket to a place on the court behind the 3-point arc. 
2. The defensive player is not allowed to play for the ball in the arc underneath the basket.

During the course of the game, whenever the possession of the ball changes, the team in control of the ball must dribble or pass the ball to a place on the court behind the 3-point arc. 

**3 second violation**
1. Offensive: A player shall not remain in the restricted area for more than 3 consecutive seconds while the team is in control of the live ball and the game clock is running
2. Defensive: A player shall not remain in the resticted area for more than 3 consecutive seconds without actively guarding a player while the game clock is running.

To establish a player as outside the restricted area, both the feet must be planted outside the restricted area.

**Common Ball**  

A Common ball situation will be dealt with by handing possession of the ball to the teams alternatively. This would be switched during half time. 

**Substitution**  

Substitution is only permitted during a dead ball situation

**Technical Fouls**  

Each team shall do its best to secure victory, but this must be done in the spirit of sportsmanship and fair play

A Technical foul is a non-contact foul of a behavioural nature including but not limited to:
+ Disrespectfully dealing with the players/audience/ref/OC
+ Using language or gestures likely to offend players/audience/ref/OC
+ Excessive swinging of elbows
+ Fake being fouled or exaggerating contact

A Technical foul shall be counted towards the team fouls, and the opponent will be awarded 1 free throw. The game starts with the ball being administered to the team which had posession of the ball before the technical foul.

Two technical fouls leads to ejection from the game, and five technical fouls leads to ejection from the tournament.

**Personal Fouls**

Any personal foul committed during the act of shooting, layup or dunking leads to 2 or 3 free throws depending on the location of the player on the court.

**Team Fouls**
